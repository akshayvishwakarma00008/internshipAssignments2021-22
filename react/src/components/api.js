        description:"Aimed at the Maruti-Suzuki S-Presso and Renault Kwid, this hatchback with SUV styling should be a half-size larger dimensionally and will slot in below the Nexon in the line-up. Being a Tata car, expect space, ride comfort and features to be its competitive edge over its rivals, with power from Tata's Revotron 1.2-litre, 3-cylinder petrol. Based on the new ALFA platform also underpinning the Altroz, we've seen it as the H2X concept at the Geneva show last year. Going by how close to show car the Altroz is, we expect it to remain quite true to form when it finally hits showrooms. We especially hope the rear AC vents as on the H2X concept make it.",
